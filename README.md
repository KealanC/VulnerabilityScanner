# VulnerabilityScanner


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I set out to utilize the Nessus vulnerablility scanner to first conduct a non-credentiated scan on a Windows 10 virtual machine. Following this scan I then conducted a credentiated scan to see if any more vulnerabilities would be revealed than on the non-credentiated scan. Once this was completed I decided to test if installing an old version of Mozilla Firefox on the VM would created more vulnerabilities. Once this scan was complete I then attempted to remediate the detected vulnerabilties and ran a final scan to see if my efforts had succeeded.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>VMWare Fusion 13Pro</b> 
- <b>Windows 10 ISO</b>
- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 OS</b> 

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
First is to download and install the Windows 10 VM and Nessus Essentials scanner. For this project the VM network connection must be configured to be a bridged connection to allow the VM to communicate with the Nessus scanner: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now to test the connection to the VM by using the host terminal to ping the IP of the VM. As we can see here the packets are not being receieved so the VM settings must be reconfigured: <br/>

<br />
<br />
To fix the connectivity issue I am going to disable the 3 Windows firewall options in the VM and retest using the ping. As we can see the packets are now successfully being recieved by the VM:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now to create a new scan using the basic network scan template and run it. This will conduct a general non-credentiated scan with the Nessus scanner.

<br />
<br />
Click into the scan to view the results:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now to configure the Windows machine to be able to conduct a credentiated scan on it. The first step to do this is to navigate to the component services and set the Remote Registry Properties from disabled to automatic. Following this I then navigated through the registry editor to create a new DWORD file and set the value to 1:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now to set up the Nessus Scanner to run a Windows credentiated scan by entering the username and password for the Windows VM. Once the scan is saved then run the scan again and view the results:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now to download the old version of Mozilla Firefox in the VM and see how it impacts the scan results. A quick google search will return some downloads for older version of the search engine. Once downloaded install and run the firefox application:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
After running the scan and inspecting the results we can see that the outdated browser download had a huge impact in the amount of vulnerabilities detected:

<br />
<br />
Now I set out to attempt to remediate the vulnerabilities which were detected. This first started with uninstalling the Mozilla browser which I downlaoded earlier. Following this I saw that the VM was behind in updates and as a result was missing a large variety of secuirty features which would lead to the VM having various gaps in security which could be exploited:

<br />
<br />
Finally we will run another scan and determine if the steps I took had actually reduced the amount of vulnerabilties. As seen below by uninstalling the outdated browser and updating the machine to the most recent software the amount of vulnerabilties greatly reduced:
